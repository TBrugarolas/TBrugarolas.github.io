            I'm a senior undergraduate studying EECS at UC Berkeley and part time student
            assistant for the  Laser Tech Group at Berkeley Lab led by Professor 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassilia_Zorba">Vassilia Zorba</a>. 
            My current research explores the uses of lasers for isotopic analysis and 
            manufacturing. In my time at Berkeley Lab I have contributed to 3 projects
            with optical alignment, experiement optimization, data pipeline automation,
            data analysis, and data visualization.
        </p>

            Lately, I have been exploring control theory and machine learning through coursework 
            at UC Berkeley which has shifted my research interests toward the intersection of 
            the two for safe and robust robotics. I find myself most interested in pursuing a 
            graduate study focused on developing theory and algorithms and deploying them on 
            physical robotic systems. More specifically, my goal is to research the robustness 
            and optimality guarantees of hybrid controllers in safety-critical applications, 
            such as interacting with humans or operating large networks of robots in dynamic environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to Berkeley, I completed my Associates degree at Pasadena City College 
            and explored Laser Technology under the guidance of Dr. Brian Monacelli.
            In my spare time you are most likely to find me playing Ultimate Frisbee with the 
            Ursa Minor team or at home playing games.
