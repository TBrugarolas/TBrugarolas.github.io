        data-content="I have worked closely with our engineering associate, Mr. Ito, on programming the 
                gantry crane that serves as our primary robotic manipulator, enabling sample 
                transfer between fabrication and measurement stations. We are developing an operation 
                loop capable of scheduling and parallelizing tasks. Also, we coordinate the crane's 
                movement with subsystem linear stages for efficient, fully automated handoffs. In all, 
                the system logs the results for each set of laser parameters, then, depending on the 
                application a specialized AI algorithm, selects the next candidates through multi-objective 
                optimization. My contributions to this project will facilitate the search for optimized 
                surface patternings so that inexpensive, common materials with patterned surfaces can 
                rival the performance of expensive materials and coatings currently used in industry. [Slides Coming Soon]"

        data-content="I assisted Dr. Awasthi with investigating the effect of laser patterning on the transmissivity 
                and reflectivity in the terahertz gap. Due to the large search space of candidate surface 
                textures, we train a flow matching algorithm to predict the result of laser writing 
                parameters and leverage novel sampling algorithms to select next best candidates for 
                testing. The goal is to converge on the laser patterning parameters needed to generate 
                specific filter responses. My latest work has been on optimizing the systems performance 
                by analyzing time and frequency domain responses and automating the pipeline for efficiently 
                curating and benchmarking new samples that are fed back into the machine learning algorithm. 
                This has enabled us to generate large machine learning friendly datasets with improved 
                efficiency. My work has contributed to the “Towards Autonomous Discovery of Terahertz 
                Devices via Integrated Design Fabrication Characterization Loop” presentation given by Dr. Awasthi
                at the 2026 SPIE Photonics West Conference along with a manuscript in progress. [Slides Coming Soon]"

        <a class="openModalBtn" data-title="Optical Centrifuge for Isotope Detection" 
        data-content="I assisted senior scientist Dr. Paeng with investigating the effects of minute changes 
                in our optical alignment on output beam aberrations, power, and timing. We used a 
                Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) system to measure the delay between split 
                pulses and the amount our optical system stretched the pulse width to the precision of 
                tens of femtoseconds. I was also able to derive relationships between small angular 
                adjustments to the severity of beam aberrations, such as coma, astigmatism, and defocus 
                to find the optimal angles for alignment. Together, this allowed my mentor and I to 
                systematically adjust the optical alignment to control the relative delay, pulse widths, 
                and polarizations of the laser beams while also minimizing aberrations to prepare for the 
                next stage of the experiment. There, the centrifuge output will be used as input to a 
                Raman Spectrometer to excite the particle's quantum J state and produce a more detailed 
                isotope spectrum. This improved resolution can support future technology for fast, accurate 
                safety checks on the quality of Uranium being produced in the U.S. [Slides Coming Soon]"

        <a class="openModalBtn" data-title="Turtlebot Interceptor - EECS 106A Final Project"
        data-content="I explored model predictive control (MPC) for real-time optimal planning and obstacle avoidance. 
                Our goal was for one TurtleBot to identify and intercept another in an unknown environment. 
                The seeker TurtleBot used a closed loop controller that combined LIDAR and camera data to 
                generate a fast, locally consistent mapping of the obstacles, while IMU and magnetic field 
                measurements were incorporated into Kalman filters for reliable state estimation of both robots. 
                The biggest challenge in this project was overcoming the sim-to-real gap, which we addressed 
                by employing the Kalman filtering and adding in the camera feed to improve the reliability of 
                information being passed into our MPC algorithm and tuning our cost function parameters. My 
                contributions were mainly with communicating target and obstacle information to the seeker TurtleBot."
